<p>
<span class="dropcap" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">W</span>elcome to my desk. 
</p>

<p>
This area is for writers. All writers. I don't believe in the term "aspiring" writer. You are a writer or you are not. I aspire to put a period at the end of this sentence. There, I did it. So, I'm no longer aspiring. If you've written anything&mdash;even if it sucks, you are a writer. Getting <i>paid</i> to write is a whole 'nuther box of doughnuts. 
</p>

<p>
Let's tackle some of the most often asked questions...
</p>

<!-- 
<a class="anchorlink" name="agent" ><hr class="mtr" style="width:350px;" /></a>


<h2>HOW DO I GET AN AGENT?</h2> 

<p>
<span class="dropcap" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">I</span>f you've spent any time around writing conferences, or paid money for how-to books on writing, you've certainly heard your share of stories about query letters, and networking, and a myriad of other ways to get an agent. 
</p>

<p>
I don't know how or when this idea got started, but so many people think getting an agent is the secret to success. While it may be for an actor or a model, I'm about to drop some serious science on you. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="redbold"><i>You don't need an agent.</i></span> 
</p>

<p>
That's right. At least not to get that first job. And usually not even that second job.
</p>

<p>
I have been a working (meaning getting paid) screenwriter for over a dozen years. I know hundreds of writers. I know dozens of agents. I know dozens and dozens of studio and network executives. Not one of them has ever told me about how an agent helped a writer get that first job. 
</p>

<p>
Not one. None of the writers I know got their first job because of an agent. Not one. Here is how you get your first job...
</p>

<p>
You write your ass off, then you get your best work in front of the right eyes&mdash;meaning the eyes of executives, showrunners, other writers, etc. But I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "But, Paul, how can I get my stuff in front of those people without an agent?" 
</p>

<p>
It's actually easier to do than with an agent. Forget about getting an agent. Forget about wasting time and energy on query letters and books of agencies and their employees. Instead, take all that time and energy and dump it into your writing. 
</p>

<p>
Then enter contests. Legit contests. Like Austin, Nicholl and TrackingB. Not because a bunch of junior agents check these out, but because lots of LEGIT producers and production companies do. And they love new writers because you come cheap. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to write television, then MOVE TO LA. And get a job as a writers assistant&mdash;this is the single fastest way to get paid to write an episode of television. Every TV show is required by the WGA to give a certain number of episodes to "freelance writers." That means writers who are either unemployed, or have never written professionally. From my experience, 90% of these freelance episodes are given to writers assistants as a thank you for their hard work. 
</p>

<p>
Let me say it one more time&mdash;agents do not help you get that first job. They come on board AFTER you've gotten a gig; and trust me, they will call you.

<h2>RECOMMENDED READING</h2>

<p>
<span class="dropcap" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">I</span> believe nearly all how-to books on screenwriting are crap. Almost every one is written by someone who failed to ever forge a career as a screenwriter, or maybe they wrote one movie that got made, then failed to ever deliver anything good enough to remain employed, and thus, took to "teaching." 
</p>

<p>
I believe anyone who spends money on Robert McKee's overpriced, overcomplicated, overblown STORY seminars would do much more for their career if they took that money and used it to go have life experiences away from the keyboard. 
</p>

<p>
How-to books and writing seminars can teach you how to construct a story or plot, they can teach you where to place inciting incidents and give you ideas on creating characters, but none of them can teach you how to write.
</p>

<p>
Tony Gilroy said it best&mdash;<i>"The quality of your writing is absolutely capped at your understanding of human behavior. You will never write above what you know about people."</i>
</p>

<p>
Let me type that again... The quality of your writing is absolutely capped at your understanding of human behavior. You will never write above what you know about people.
</p>

<p>
I believe there has never been a greater truth spoken about writing. 
</p>

<p>
McKee and Field and Vogler and Snyder and Truby and all the rest CANNOT TEACH YOU ONE THING ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR. 
</p>

<p>
So, save your money and go experience life. 
</p>

<p>
Now, why is this section called Recommended Reading? Because I do believe there are some books that are certainly worth reading. But as you'll see from my list, they are not the cookie cutter versions; they are about the inside part of writing. The good part. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</i> by Stephen King</span><br/>
The first half of this excellent book is about how King "became" a writer. The second half is one of the best manuals on the nuts & bolts of writing from a craft standpoint, and King does not pull any punches.
</p> 


<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>Bird By Bird</i> by Anne Lamott</span><br/>
Funny and smart, just like the author. This book won't give you tips on an inciting incident or how many pages your third act should be, but you'll probably write better after reading it just for the brief glimpse inside Lamott's brilliant mind. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>Shakespeare For Screenwriters</i> by J. M. Evenson</span><br/>
This is a newer title that I came across recently via Twitter. I was skeptical, but when I read it, I found it to be short, insightful and fresh. The author breaks down some of the greatest stories by one of our greatest scribes, and along the way offers ways to apply his work to yours. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>The 101 Habits of Highly Successful Screenwriters</i> by Karl Iglesias</span><br/>
I love this book because there's no BS. It is simply a Q&A with some of the most successful (and best) screenwriters in the business. Don't just pay attention to what they're saying, but be aware of what they're NOT saying. 
</p>


<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</i> by Haruki Murakami</span><br/>
This book is about running, but under the surface, it is about writing, and the writer's life. It's great for inspiration, as well as how to think your way out of blocked situations, writing and otherwise. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>Fiction</i></span><br/>
No, not a book titled "Fiction"&mdash;I mean fiction. Novels. Short stories. Not screenplays. Yes, reading screenplays can help you because reading anything can help you. But I believe reading fiction (good fiction) can give a screenwriter something reading screenplays can't... a deeper look into character and subtext and description. 
</p>

<p>
When we pen a screenplay we have parameters such as page count and blocks of lines, sometimes even production issues. But novels and short stories are all about the story. All about the writing. And when you read quality fiction, your writer's mind just automatically goes to work while you're reading and imagining and digesting. I've learned more as a screenwriter from reading John Updike and Flannery O'Connor and James Lee Burke than I ever did from reading screenplays.

<h2>INSPIRATION</h2>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>Music</i></span><br/>
For me, music is my single greatest inspiration. I simply cannot write anything without music.  
</p>

<p>
When on staff of a television series, I have given more than one showrunner a heart attack because I could not start writing my episode until I found the right music. 
</p>

<p>
I have over 6200 songs on my iTunes. I have playlists for every project I write. I will spend days (and at times weeks) searching for the right music for whatever I am writing. Once I do, I listen to that playlist over and over and over as I write. Sometimes, the playlist gets altered as I go. Certain songs will get added or deleted, but the guts of it remains the same. 
</p>

<p>
I will be listing the playlists of certain writing projects on this site from time to time, so be sure and check back in with the WritersDesk when you can. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>Visuals</i></span><br/>
I write screenplays mainly, though am diving deeper into the prose world. But my day job is screenwriting, and that is a visual medium. Certain screenwriters are praised for their "cinematic" style... what does that mean? They write visually. It would serve you well to do the same. 
</p>

<p>
When I am working on a project, I will put photos up on my desktop or walls&mdash;photos of either the locations where my story is taking place, or photos that simply inspire me. Like my playlists, I will post photos here from time to time coinciding with whatever project I'm typing. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="goldbold"><i>Heroes</i></span><br/>
We all have people who inspire us from time to time. For that reason, I give you my own personal <a href="gallery-of-heroes.php">GALLERY OF HEROES</a>. 
</p>

<h2>OTHER STUFF</h2>


<!-- 
<p>		
<span class="dropcap" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">S</span>o, you've stumbled across one of my favorite sections here at paulguyot.net. Being a writer, I, of course, love to procrastinate, and the Internet was invented for procrastination.  
</p>

<p>
Below you'll find an assortment of things that interest me. I am not paid to promote or endorse any of the links or companies here. This is just what this one particular scribe likes, and you might, too. 
</p>

<p>
As stated, I love music. It is a huge part of who I am as a writer and person. The guitar is probably my favorite instrument, though it's close. This is who I believe is the greatest guitarist who ever lived&mdash;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Buchanan" target="_blank">Roy Buchanan</a>.
</p>

<p>
I love watches, specifically classic, well-made watches. I believe time is too precious to be kept on a cheap watch. My favorite haute horology site is <a href="http://www.watchprosite.com" target="_blank">The Purist</a>.
</p>

<p>
One of my passions is football, what we Americans call soccer. And my greatest soccer passion is <a href="http://www.fcbarcelona.com" target="_blank">Bar&ccedil;a</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another passion of mine is cycling. I believe professional cyclists are the single toughest athletes on the planet, with bull riders second. Here are a few companies that I feel produce some of the finest cycling gear around...

<p>
<span class="dropcap" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">A</span>nd finally, something that is so disturbing, so utterly horrifying, that it should never be seen by anyone anywhere ever... except <a href="http://paulguyot.net/vid/dh.mov" target="_blank">here</a>.
