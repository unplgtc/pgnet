<p>
<span class="dropcap" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">P</span>aul Guyot was born in a small desert town to a blue collar father and Ten High drinking mother. Prior to finding his passion for the written word, Paul exercised his imagination during his early years converting the side yard of his boyhood home into the great football stadiums and golf courses of the world. 
</p>

<p>
If you drove by the corner of 81st Street and Palm Lane in the late 70's, chances were you caught a glimpse of Paul diving for a pass in Lambeau Field, or chipping in on the 18th green at Augusta to win the Masters. 
</p>

<p>
While that extracurricular imagination did not serve him well in school&mdash;Paul spent 61.7% of his elementary years in the principal's office&mdash;it did form the beginnings of a writer. 
</p>

<p>
A quiet and fairly forgettable high school career followed, where Paul was once again summoned to the principal's office of Coronado High School, this time only two weeks before graduation. Paul was accused of stealing audio/video equipment from the theater department&mdash;a place far too special to Paul to ever denigrate with theft. He refused to admit to something he did not do, and when given the ultimatum of either admitting he did it or not being allowed to graduate, Paul looked the principal in the eye and said, "Then I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Pictures," and walked out. 
</p>

<p>
Paul got his GED within a month and embarked on his screenwriting career... working as a cashier at a Hallmark store in a strip mall two blocks from home. Paul was always one of the sharper knives in the drawer... he just never figured out the drawer was for pots and pans. 
</p>

<p>
A short, but distinguished period at the University of Arizona followed, then Paul took that vast wealth of knowledge straight to Tinseltown. Within a few days of arriving, he secured his first job working in the heart of Hollywood... as a waiter on the graveyard shift at Denny's on the corner of Sunset and Gower.
</p>

<p>
After serving pimps, hookers, the homeless, and drunk dance club kids for several months, Paul decided to return to Arizona and seek his fortune in the golf biz. That's when God intervened in the form of a nomadic band of misfits known as the film crew for the epic HARLEY DAVIDSON & THE MARLBORO MAN. Paul got the coveted gig as stand-in for Don Johnson, and his Hollywood career was off and running... or limping, like it had a hip replacement that didn't go well. 
Over the next few years, Paul did two more pictures with Don, three with Charlie Sheen, and stood in for such names as Christian Slater, Bruce Willis, Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader and Mel Gibson. Eventually, Paul landed a dream job&mdash;personal assistant to the great Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-Fat. 
</p>

<p>
Paul and Yun-Fat bonded over long discussions about life, love, writing, and the correct pronunciation of "Looky-Loo's." Paul credits Yun-Fat with finally giving him the kick-out-of-the-nest advice he needed which finally led to Paul's first ever paid gig as a writer&mdash;a freelance episode of the short-lived ABC series SNOOPS, starring Gina Gershon and Paula Marshall as private eyes who tended to lick whipped cream off of each other during Sweeps episodes. 
</p>

<p>
The UPN drama LEVEL 9 followed, but unfortunately it aired right after HOMEBOYS IN OUTER SPACE and right before SHASTA MCNASTY, literally and metaphorically, and thus, lasted a mere 13 episodes.
</p>

<p>
Paul enjoys procrastination, er, when Paul has writer's block, he can be found riding his Trek Madone in the Santa Monica mountains or the rolling hills of Missouri. He still plays golf occasionally, and loves fishing with his son and coaching his daughters' soccer teams.
